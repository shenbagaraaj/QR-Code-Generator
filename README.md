# QR-Code-Generator
Hi Guys, This is a simple project using Node js.
If you're new to nodejs, it may be useful for you because in this project you can get to know three significant npm packages. 
Inquirer, QR-image, fs

Once you download the script file, initialize npm, install express, inquirer, fs and qr-image packages from npm. 

Keep learning. Have fun with Coding!

Thank you all.
